# Embed-AI

《Instructions for use》
1. PyTorch trains a fully connected deep neural network model.
2. Copy or cut the model.h file in the Model folder to the MCU project folder. Each time the training is completed, a folder is automatically generated and named after the time when the training is completed.
3. Copy the neural network implementation into the example/Regression/main.cpp file
4. Include model.h and enjoy your Embed-AI system!
